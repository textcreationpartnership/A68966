            <p>Created by converting TCP files to TEI P5 using tcp2tei.xsl,
      TEI @ Oxford.

         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

               <p>The difference betweene our heauenly King, and earthly Princes is great. 1. Their dominions are limi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted, and the borders of their kingdomes bounded, their people numbred, &amp; the time of their raigne preſcribed. But Chriſt hath<note n="z" place="margin">

               <p n="2">2. Other Kings haue power onely ouer our bodies and goods: but Chriſts authority reacheth vnto the ſoule. Their ſword is materiall, able onely to kill the bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy: but his ſword is ſpirituall, proceeding out of his<note n="a" place="margin">

               <p>Now the beſt way to bee learned, and to know our duty, is, to bee verſed in Gods booke, whereof there be<note n="h" place="margin">See Baſilicon Doron. pag. <hi>7. 8.</hi>
                  </note> two parts, his old Teſtament, and his new. The ground of the former is the Law, which ſheweth our ſinne, and
<pb n="92" facs="tcp:6536:50"/> containeth iuſtice: the ground of the latter is the Goſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pell, which ſheweth our Sauiour, and containeth grace. The ſumme of the law is the decalogue, more largely di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>lated in the bookes of <hi>Moſes,</hi> interpreted and applied in the Sermons of the <hi>Prophets,</hi> and illuſtrated by ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nifold examples of good and euil, in the ſtories of <hi>Chro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nicles,</hi> and <hi>Kings.</hi> But becauſe no man is able perfectly to keep the whole law, or any part therof; it pleaſed God of his infinite goodneſſe and wiſedome, to incarnate his onely Sonne in our nature, who (for the ſatisfaction of his iuſtice) might fulfil the courſe, and ſuffer the curſe of the law for vs; that ſince we could not bee ſaued by do<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ing, we might at leaſt be ſaued by beleeuing. The <hi>Goſpels</hi> of the foure Euangeliſts, hiſtorically relate the birth, life, death, reſurrection, and aſcenſion of Chriſt. The larger interpretation thereof is deliuered in the Apoſtles Ca<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nonicall <hi>Epiſtles;</hi> and the practice of the Primitiue Church, in their <hi>Acts;</hi> and the <hi>Reuelation of Saint Iohn,</hi> is a prophecie concerning the Church vniuerſall vnto the worlds end.

Now we may the better vnderſtand the greatnes of his goodnes in both, if wee will examine the breadth, and length, and depth, and height thereof, as S. <hi>Paul</hi> intimates, Epheſ. 3.18.</p>
               <pb n="165" facs="tcp:6536:86"/>
               <p>Firſt, for the breadth of his mercie, whatſoeuer is good is originally from God,<note n="x" place="margin">

Bread taketh away hunger, and drinke taketh away thirſt, and apparell ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>keth away nakedneſſe, and fire taketh away coldneſſe, and other things deliuer vs from other miſeries in this world. But all theſe creatures are the Lords, and they cannot helpe vs, except hee bleſſe them.

Moreouer, as the creatures take not away all miſeries, but a few, ſo they take them away not from all, but from a few.

               <p>Concerning our promotion in good, the reſurrection of Chriſt is a proofe of our iuſtification, a meanes of our ſanctification, a demonſtration of our reſurrection. Firſt, it proueth our iuſtification, according to that of <hi>Paul,</hi> Rom. 4.25. <hi>He was giuen to death for our ſinnes, and is riſen againe from the dead for our iuſtification.</hi> See the Goſpell on S. <hi>Thomas</hi> day.</p>
               <p>Secondly, the reſurrection of Chriſt is a notable meanes to worke inward ſanctification, as Saint <hi>Peter</hi> teacheth in 1. Epiſtle 1. Chap. 3. Verſe, <hi>God hath begot<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ten vs againe vnto a liuely hope, by the reſurrection of Ie<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſus Chriſt from the dead.</hi> And Saint<note n="m" place="margin">
                     <hi>Rom.</hi> 6.4.5.</note> 
                  <hi>Paul, As Chriſt was raiſed vp from the dead, by the glory of his Father; ſo we ſhould alſo walke in newneſſe of life; For if we be graf<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ted with him to the ſimilitude of his death, euen ſo ſhall we be to the ſimilitude of his reſurrection.</hi> Which words im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>port,<note n="n" place="margin">Aquin.

<pb n="175" facs="tcp:6536:91"/> become one body with it: euen ſo the faithfull haue their liuing, and ſpirituall being in Chriſt. As he by the power of his owne Godhead, freed his manhood from death, and from the guilt of our ſin; ſo doth he likewiſe free thoſe, that are knit vnto him by the bond of one ſpirit, from the corruption of their natures in which they are dead, that they may liue vnto God.<note n="o" place="margin">Raymund. de Sabunde Theo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>log. natural. tit. <hi>277.</hi>
                  </note> In the naturall body, the head is the fountaine of all motion and ſenſe; for the hands and the feet moue by that power, which is by ſundry nerues deriued from the head, and diſperſed among the members. And ſo it is in (Chriſts myſtical bo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dy) the Church; hee is the head and fountaine of life ſpi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rituall, and<note n="p" place="margin">Perkins expo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſit.

Chriſt reſur.</note> that very power of his Godhead, whereby he raiſed vp himſelfe when hee was dead, he conuaieth from himſelfe to his members, and thereby raiſeth them vp from the death of ſinne, to newnes of life. For the better vnderſtanding of this point, let vs examine the meanes and the meaſure of the ſpirituall life.</p>
               <p>For the meanes, if wee will haue common water, we may goe to the common well; and if we deſire water of Life, we muſt haue recourſe vnto Chriſt, who ſaith,<note n="q" place="margin">

                  <hi>hee ſhall haue a well of water ſpringing vp into euerlaſting life.</hi> Now this well, (as the woman of Samaria ſaid of <hi>Iacobs</hi> well) <hi>is very deepe, and we haue nothing to draw with.</hi> And therefore wee muſt haue pipes and conduits to conuay the ſame vnto vs; and theſe pipes are the ſin<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cere preaching of the word, and the right adminiſtration of the Sacraments. As for the preaching of Gods holy Word, Chriſt openly proclaimeth in the fifth of S. <hi>Iohns</hi> Goſpell, at the 25 Verſe, <hi>The dead ſhall heare the voyce of the Sonne of God, and they that heare it, ſhall liue.</hi>

The firſt day (ſaith <hi>Augu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtine</hi>) hee was dead, by conceiuing ſinne: the ſecond, by conſenting to ſinne: the third, by committing ſinne: the fourth, by continuing in ſinne.

After their raiſing vp, <hi>Iairus</hi> daughter inſtantly walked; becauſe for her that had ſtept aſide but by conſenting to ſinne, it was eaſie to recouer, and to walke foorth-with in the waies of Gods holie Commandements. The widowes ſonne <hi>ſat vp, began to ſpeake, was deliuered to his mother;</hi> becauſe for him, which had actually tranſgreſſed, it was a matter of grea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter
<pb n="177" facs="tcp:6536:92"/> difficultie to recouer, and therefore by little and lit<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tle hee came to it, as<note n="c" place="margin">Con. de miſeri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cord. Domini.</note>
